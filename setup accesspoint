To setup the wifi accesspoint on the RPI follow these steps:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point-routed.md

After that install nginx for forwarding: 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/nginx.md

Setup nginx:
////
Create a new file:
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/1pekway

Copy the following code into that file:
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name peka.way;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1880/ui/;
  }
}


Then restart nginx with the command:
sudo systemctl restart nginx


If everything worked out, you can now reach the dashboard by simply browsing to peka.way.

Standard wifi access:
wifikey: pekawayYES
ssid:pekwaDIYcontrol
