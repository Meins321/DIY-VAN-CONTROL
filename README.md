Build a Raspberry-Pi/node-Red Van Control System. 


This system is based on Node-Red, so it can be used on different platforms. 
It will have a modulare flow system. Each flow provid a seperate function. 

is working: 
- Nextion Display
- DS18b20
- Webasto - W-bus integration. 


Quick Start. - Self install
1. Install Node.js & Node-red
2. Import the MainFlow
3. Setup your ports. Setup your modules.
4. Import the flows
5. Toggle all Flows you donÂ´t use to inactive
6. install the used nodes:
  - node-red-contrib-ads1x15
  - node-red-contrib-binary
  - node-red-contrib-ds18b20-sensor
  - ncd-red-comm
